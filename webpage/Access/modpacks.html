    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>We have played a total of three modded SMPs on the server. We had one tech-based modpack, one race to the moon modpack, and now we have a magic modpack.
    We will have many more modded SMP's and nobody is running out of any ideas for modpacks. This page is meant for easy access to the modpacks we use on the server, so anyone who wants to join  or try them out can just download them from here.
    Below here are most of the modpacks we have used on the server. (some of the modpacks were unbalanced or boring, so we didin't include them here)</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Race to the Moon Modpack</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>This modpack was very fun, although later on it gets a bit grindy. Basically was inspired from the modpack used in the youtube series race to the moon, made by some youtubers Who MiracleSheep liked to watch as a child.</p>
    Here's a link to the first episode: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dXOVze5hRk">Minecraft - Race To The Moon - Lets Do This! [1].</a></p>
    Basically, you split into teams, and the first one to the moon wins. This modpack has all of the mods used in the series and a few more.
      Here is the download:</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>1.12.2 Ice Age Modpack</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>This modpack was a challenge modpack. It was inspired from a video by AsianHalfSquat, suggested by Xtreem_Piggy17. Here's a link to the video this modpack was taken from: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zdnNJdlUBU">How To Turn Minecraft Into An Ice Age Survival Game.</a></p> 
    This version of the modpack has some of the mods in the video removed, since specific mobs were crashing the server. 
    Basically, it is an ice age challenge, meant for hardcore. the main mod is the tough as nails mod, and a mod that makes it constantly winter.</p>
    It was in hardcore, but it was very difficult, so we gave everyone three lives.
    Here is the download:</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>1.12.2 Magic Modpack</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>This modpack was a meant for an SMP. It is full of magic mods.
      It is very hard to start out, but becomes much easier as time goes on. It is a very balanced modpack.</p>
      There are a few optional grindy mods, but the main attractions are the dimension mods, including the Aether, Twighlight forest, Midnight dimension, and Betweenlands.</p>
      There is also the Ice and Fire mod, which adds dragons and other amazing creatures to the game, which makes starting out difficult.</p>
