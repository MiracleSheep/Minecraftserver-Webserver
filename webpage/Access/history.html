    <p>The MiracleSheep server has hosted many different SMPs as well as adventure maps and events. </p>
    <p>The amount of events and adventure maps played on the server are to numerous to count, so this history page will document all of the SMPs on the server. </p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>The first vanilla world was the first SMP on the MiracleSheep server. It included around 11 people.</p>
    <p>The SMP spanned from versions 1.14 to 1.15.</p>
    <p>Everyone built relatively small houses close to one another, and had an underground town hall for meetings and gear. </p>
    <p>One of the largest projects on the SMP was a guardian farm, to gain more exp.</p>
    <p>There are not many photos from this era. Most of them are buried in the history of the MiracleSheep discord server.</p>
    <p>Once everyone was bored with the vanilla, many mods were added to in order to make it interesting.</p>
    <p>When the SMP was finished, the modpack was lost and the world was corrupted.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>The First Modded SMP</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>The first modded world lasted for a short time on the MiracleSheep server. It included around 5 people.</p>
    <p>The SMP was in forge version 1.12.2.</p>
    <p>It included a mix of tech and magic mods with no clear objective. </p>
    <p>Everyone's houses were extremely far apart, and everyone was working with different mods.</p>
    <p>There are not many photos from this era, because the SMP ended early as everyone got bored with it.</p>
    <p>The modpack was lost and the world was corrupted.</p>

    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>The Race to the Moon SMP</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>This was one of the best modded SMPs on the server. It included around 7 people.</p>
    <p>The SMP was in forge version 1.12.2.</p>
    <p>It included a mostly tech mods, with a clear objective of racing to the moon. </p>
    <p>Everyone was split into two teams. Whoever got to the moon first would win.</p>
    <p>There were two bases for each team, although after the space race they would all move to the mountains.</p>
    <p>MiracleSheep, Xtreem_Piggy17, and Crazyfr0g_ won the space race to the moon.</p>
    <p>Afterwards, everyone worked together to get to the other planets and a giant space station was constructed but not entirely finished.</p>
    <p>The world was corrupted, but the modpack still exists.</p>
    <p>There may be a second race to the moon SMP.</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

    <p>This SMP included around 7 people and was heavily magic themed.</p>
    <p>The SMP was in forge version 1.12.2.</p>
    <p>Everyone built their houses far from eachother, and would come together to defeat bosses.</p>
    <p>The main goal of this SMP was to explore all five dimensions the mods added.</p>
    <p>The modpack is avalable for download, and the world is still on the server.</p>
    <p>The history of this SMP is well documented.</p>

  <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">

  <p>The second vanilla world is the second SMP on the MiracleSheep server. It includes around 10 people.</p>
  <p>The houses built in this SMP are close, but more scattered than the last SMP. They are also many times larger. </p>
  <p>This SMP was inspired by the hermitcraft series and spanned versions 1.15 to 1.16. It contains plugins as well as a shopping district with diamonds as currency.</p>
  <p>There are a variety of massive projects on this SMP, many of which include farms.</p>
  <p>This is one of the most well recorded eras of the server. There are many photos from the server on discord.</p>
  <p>This SMP is still alive today, and we will move on to the third SMP when the second caves and cliffs update comes out around christmas.</p>
